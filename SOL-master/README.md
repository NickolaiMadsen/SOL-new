Spiral of Life - online applikation

This application is version of a MVP for the game Spiral of Life. The players can play the game in a very simple form. 

By pressing "Next Question" a reflective question will appear on the screen from the selected 'Level'.

The player now have 120 seconds to talk about what ever comes up when reading the question. When the time is up - the next player can begin. 

If some of the players have a questions that they want to include in the game, the player can press the icon in the top-right corner and write down the question and it will appear in the level. (There is a minor bug, where the question also appears in level 1)

Thanks for playing!
